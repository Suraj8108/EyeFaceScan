# Eye and Face Detection using OpenCV

## Overview

This project leverages OpenCV to detect faces and eyes in photos. It is part of a larger application that encrypts pixel values based on the detection results from OpenCV. The detected values are then shared with the encryption application to ensure secure processing.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Identifies and locates faces within an image.
- **Eye Detection**: Detects and highlights eyes within the detected faces.
- **Integration with Encryption Logic**: Shares detection results with an encryption application for secure pixel value processing.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **OpenCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations on image data.

## Installation
